NOTES

* Note that the starter code for this module includes a service worker. The service worker inclusion is no longer the default behavior for the most recent version of the create-react-app utility. When using this utility in the future to make an app from scratch, remember that some additional arguments are required to add a service worker to your app. For more information, refer to the Create React App documentation on creating a PWA (Links to an external site.).

A lot of our state-across components relies on component-level Apollo query results. Those results affect the overall functionality that determines what we see in other components of our app, meaning other components need to constantly be made aware of those results, which is cumbersome. So by taking that returned data from the query result and storing it in a global state, we can effectively remove a lot of confusing data movement between components to keep them in sync.

Redux allows developers to centralize all of the data needed to make an application run properly and set it up in a global object that makes the data easy to use by the UI but also predictable in terms of how it's updated. Redux is built on the following three core principles, which aren't totally unique to Redux, as we'll soon see:

    - Single source of truth: By having all of the application's data stored in one location that isn't tied to any single piece of the UI, we can easily manipulate our app's UI without having to affect any of it.

    - State is read-only: This doesn't mean state can't be updated, but rather that it cannot be directly updated. Instead, it should be overwritten with a new iteration of that state. This makes it so that the application's state is updated in a predictable fashion and the UI won't ever get out of sync with its data.

    - State is changed through pure functions: This means that to make an update to state, we don't actually manipulate it. Instead, we overwrite it with a new version of it. This lowers the chance of any data being accidentally affected by an action. We do this by creating what's known as a reducer, which runs as a result of an action.

The name for a global state object is often referred to as a Store.

A global store is built on two important pieces when it comes to updating state:

    Actions: These define the types of events that can be emitted to update state. State can only be updated if it's a predefined action.

    Reducers: 
        A reducer is a function that updates state by returning a new state object and never alters the original state object. Now, that doesn't mean the data inside the state object isn't altered. Of course, it isâ€”why else would we need to update state? The key takeaway here is that state is intended to be immutable, meaning it never should be directly altered in any way. The reason for this is that it goes behind the state management system's back and it isn't informed that something has changed

Because of this relationship, we'll need to create our actions before we create our reducers.

    Actions and reducers have a very similar relationship to how we use typeDefs and resolvers with GraphQL. We need to define what's to be interacted with, and then write the functionality that carries out that interaction.

* All we're doing is learning another way of managing state so that it's decoupled from our components. With our state decoupled, we can use it across more components and pages in our application and avoid making more HTTP calls than necessary or more importantly, prop drilling.

Prop drilling is what happens when we manage state at a top-level component that needs to be passed through multiple child components as props. When the data is passed around too much, it becomes difficult to keep track of which components are reliant on which data. To remedy this, creating a global state object will allow any component in our application to use and update state without having to worry about receiving that information as props. This will make our component much more readable, and create data much more reusable over time.

Every Context object comes with two components, a Provider and Consumer. 
    
    The Provider is a special type of React component that we wrap our application in so it can make the state data that's passed into it as a prop available to all other components. 
    
    The Consumer is our means of grabbing and using the data that the Provider holds for us.

* This is a lot to absorb, for both beginners and veterans in the web development community! But it seems to be a solution that isn't going away any time soon. The good thing is, after practicing and implementing it a few times, it's actually not too bad! Just like GraphQL, it just requires a bit more planning ahead of time, as you need to plan out what you want to hold in a global state object and how to actually update it using actions and reducers.

* Why would we save the current product locally and not to the global state?
    
    This is one of those cases where saving a single product to the global state object doesn't actually benefit us in any way, shape, or form. The single product's data will only be used in this specific component at this specific moment. This is the same reason why we don't worry about saving form entry data from the login or signup forms to global state; it only needs to exist when we're using those components!


Lesson 3

    With the IndexedDB database, we'll accomplish the following two main performance enhancements:

    We'll store all of the product and category data from the database in IndexedDB. This way, even without an internet connection, users can still navigate the application, view items, and even add items to their shopping cart.

    If the user leaves the application and comes back later, we'll have persisted the items in their shopping cart. A user is more likely to complete their order if they don't have to add everything back into the cart!

    * We used a custom function, but there are libraries out there that offer help in working with browser storage. Try a library called LocalForage (Links to an external site.) if you're ever interested!


Lesson 4

    We'll use the Stripe API to process payments, which includes making front-end and back-end changes. Don't worry, Stripe provides test credentials, so you won't need to use a real credit card to try it out.

    E-commerce is a big part of the web and an important skill to have, and Stripe is a developer-friendly entry point for learning about it. On the job, however, there's a good chance that you'll use other services, like Shopify, which have really taken over the e-commerce space.

    It's important to test out an API before you commit to using it, whether it's a third-party API or one you built yourself.

    We're using a test key copied from the Stripe documentation. Because it's only a test key, it's fine to include it directly in the JavaScript file. Once you create a real Stripe account, however, you would want to replace this with an environment variable (e.g., process.env.STRIPE_KEY).

    We used the Stripe API to create a product ID and price ID for each item. We'll follow the Node.js code snippets that are available on Stripe's "Accept a payment" documentation (Links to an external site.).

    Note that we need to multiply the price by 100, because Stripe stores prices in cents, not dollars.

    In the Playground's query panel, write the following query:

        ```
        query checkout($products: [ID]!) {
            checkout(products: $products) {
                session
            }
        }
        ```
    Open the query variables panel and add the following JSON, making sure to replace the MongoDB IDs with IDs from your own database:

        ```
        {
            "products": ["5e87b3d5de0eac6d5820bdfb", "5e87b3d5de0eac6d5820bdff"]
        }
        ```
    You can quickly retrieve IDs from your own database using the following GraphQL query:

        ```
        query {
            products {
                _id
            }
        }
        ```
    Copy and paste the returned session ID into the HTML file in directory 'stripe-checkout'.

    You can fill out the payment form with fake details, and Stripe will simulate processing it for you. For the credit card, use the number 4242 4242 4242 4242. The other details don't matter.

    After you submit the form, though, the browser will redirect to a 404 page. If you inspect the URL, it will be something like https://example.com/success?session_id=<session>. The good and bad news is that it's working as designed. When we created the checkout session, we left the example.com domain as the success_url and cancel_url properties.

    Every HTTP request includes headers that provide additional information about the request being made. The Content-Type header, for instance, lets you know what type of content is being requested, whether it's text/html or multipart/form-data.

    By default, GraphQL resolvers don't have access to header information. The ApolloServer, however, can be configured to provide a context. One use for context is to preserve the headers from the original request, which the Shop-Shop app already does for you.

    Unfortunately, we couldn't call useQuery(QUERY_CHECKOUT) in the click handler function. The useQuery Hook is meant to run when a component is first rendered, not at a later point in time based on a user action like a button click.
    
    Apollo provides another Hook for this exact situation. The useLazyQuery Hook can be declared like any other Hook but won't actually execute until you tell it to.

    the useLazyQuery Hook can delay the execution of a GraphQL query until a user action is performed. So you could use this React Hook if you wanted to retrieve a list of items from the database after a user clicks a button?
